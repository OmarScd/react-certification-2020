## How to use

### Login

Username -> any string is valid, this string will be used as a reference to the favorite videos of the user. For example, if you log in as 'foo', add some videos to favorites, log out, and then log in as 'bar'; you won't see the favorite videos related to 'bar', but if you log in again as 'foo', you will see the added videos from your last session as 'foo'.

Password -> this will not be recorded, the only condition is that the field is not empty.

### Add to favorites

You need to log in in order to be able to see and use this feature.

### Search

If you are in the home page, the list of videos will automatically refresh once you stop writing.

If you are in any other page, just hit enter and it will redirect to the home page and show the results of your query.
