          "Live @ Earl's Court London 1994  P.U.L.S.E.\nLYRICS\n\"Wish You Were Here\"\nSo, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.\nCan you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?\nA smile from a veil?\nDo you think you can tell?\n\nDid they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?\nHot ashes for trees?\nHot air for a cool breeze?\nCold comfort for change?\nDid you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?\n\nHow I wish, how I wish you were here.\nWe're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,\nRunning over the same old ground.\nWhat have we found?\nThe same old fears.\nWish you were here.\n\n\"Comfortably Numb\"\n\nHello,\nIs there anybody in there\nJust nod if you can hear me\nIs there anyone at home\nCome on now\nI hear you're feeling down\nI can ease your pain\nAnd get you on your feet again\nRelax\nI'll need some information first\nJust the basic facts\nCan you show me where it hurts\n\nThere is no pain, you are receding\nA distant ship smoke on the horizon\nYou are only coming through in waves\nYour lips move but I can't hear what you're saying\nWhen I was a child I had a fever\nMy hands felt just like two balloons\nNow I've got that feeling once again\nI can't explain, you would not understand\nThis is not how I am\nI have become comfortably numb\n\nO.K.\nJust a little pin prick\nThere'll be no more aaaaaaaah!\nBut you may feel a little sick\nCan you stand up?\nI do believe it's working, good\nThat'll keep you going through the show\nCome on it's time to go.\n\nThere is no pain you are receding\nA distant ship smoke on the horizon\nYou are only coming through in waves\nYour lips move but I can't hear what you're saying\nWhen I was a child\nI caught a fleeting glimpse\nOut of the corner of my eye\nI turned to look but it was gone\nI cannot put my finger on it now\nThe child is grown\nThe dream is gone\nAnd I have become\nComfortably numb.\nSee Full Concert on this channeL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBc9f-3BbsE&list=PLVK6Pev6qU30uW-0pgaTTOHv0dlK6ZKIG",

        description:
          'Pink Floyd concert video taken from the 20 October 1994 concert at Earls Court, London, England in The Division Bell Tour. It was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1995.\nDavid Gilmour –  guitar, vocals \nNick Mason – drums, percussion, vocal phrase (recording)\nRick Wright – Hammond organ, synthesiser\nGuy Pratt – bass guitar\nGary Wallis – percussion, extra drums on Pulse\nTim Renwick – rhythm guitar\nJon Carin – synthesiser,\nmust not forget the ladies backing up Floyd !\nSam Brown – backing vocals\nDurga McBroom – backing vocals, \nClaudia Fontaine – backing vocals\n"Another Brick in the Wall" is a three-part composition on  Pink Floyd\'s 1979  The Wall, written by bassist Roger Waters. "Part 2", a protest song against rigid schooling,\nAt the suggestion of producer Bob Ezrin, Pink Floyd added elements of disco, which was popular at the time.\nAccording to guitarist David Gilmour:\n\n[Ezrin] said to me, "Go to a couple of clubs and listen to what\'s happening with disco music," so I forced myself out and listened to loud, four-to-the-bar bass drums and stuff and thought, Gawd, awful! Then we went back and tried to turn one of the parts into one of those so it would be catchy.\n\nGilmour recorded his guitar solo in one take, with no editing or mixing, using a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top guitar equipped with P-90 pick-ups. Despite his reservations about Ezrin\'s additions, Gilmour felt the final song still sounded like Pink Floyd. When Ezrin heard the song with a disco beat, he was convinced it could become a hit, but felt it needed to be longer, with two verses and two choruses. The band resisted, saying they did not release singles; Waters told him: "Go ahead and waste your time doing silly stuff."\nWhile the band members were away, Ezrin edited the takes into an extended version, and had engineer Nick Griffiths record children singing the verse at Islington Green School, close to Pink Floyd\'s studio. Alun Renshaw, head of music at the school, was enthusiastic, and said later: "I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – \'We don\'t need no education, we don\'t need no thought control\' ... I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids."\n\nSome of the edits for this remix are what i would call poor, bad decision making IMO  \nas one of you stated The songs and solos have been snipped and edited as if the real fans wouldn’t notice. Literally no reason to do it....example 1:01 \nOther than those  bad edits, shortened solos.....the sound and quality of video is good.',
